>
> Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that you will create will allow you to:
>
> - Add new students or teachers
> - Add new books
> - Save records of who borrowed a given book and when
> - And all of this should be built in a beautiful and well-organized way!
